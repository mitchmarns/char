                I like day-drinkin' and day parties and Hollywood. I like doin'
                Hollywood shit, snort it, probably would. What can I say? The
                shit works, it feels good, and my self-worth's at an all-time
                low.

              one of the perks of being an only child is having all of the
              attention on you all the time. picture-perfect weekends spent
              fishing on the lake or at the rink practicing, learning to love
              the same game that his father had. one of the drawbacks of being
              an only child was… well, all the attention was on you. from an
              early age, taylor idolized his father, doing anything he could to
              impress him, even if it meant pushing his relationship with his
              mother to the side. to him, his father was his best friend, his
              idol – his everything.
            </p>
            <p>
              But that bond was more fragile than taylor could have imagined.
              His father didn’t look at him like a son, but a project – someone
              to mold and push, to carry on the legacy of excellence that his
              father had started. Taylor had always been intelligent, but he
              lacked confidence in his academic abilities. No matter how hard he
              tried, he could never meet the high expectations that his father
              had set. Hockey was the only thing that connected them when
              everything else was stripped away, but even that came with
              conditions.
            </p>
            <p>
              When taylor was nine, he had the chance to play on a team far
              better than the one where he lived in Cambridge. The only problem
              was that the team was in Michigan; easily solved when a friend
              from tournaments offered him a place to stay. Their parents all
              agreed with each other that the arrangement would work fine as a
              temporary solution. However, this situation became permanent when
              his parents simply decided they didn’t want to take him back. His
              father, tired of Taylor’s rebellious streak, his impulsive
              decisions, his emotional outbursts, his struggles with self-harm
              that had presented at a young age, pushed for it and his mother
              went along with it. Just like that… he was no longer their
              responsibility.
            </p>
            <p>
              Living with chase was the first time that he was really exposed to
              what family really felt like, but still, even though their home
              was always filled with warmth, he always felt just a little bit
              alone. Chase’s mother, a single mother who worked long hours as a
              nurse to provide everything for her two sons and the young boy she
              had been stuck with. No one – not chase, his mother, or his
              brother – ever made taylor feel that he was an outsider though.
              Chase, most of all, was always by his side – through every bad
              decision, reckless night, and downward spiral. Their friendship
              wasn’t just important to taylor – it was the foundation of his
              life.
            </p>
            <p>
              Taylor made a lot of questionable choices over the years –
              partying too hard, falling into toxic relationships, struggling
              with substance abuse – but he sees it all as part of his journey.
              If nothing else, its proved to himself that he’s become his own
              person. Not the one that his father shaped him into – and maybe
              that was always the point.
